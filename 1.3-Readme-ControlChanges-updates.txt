Change Control Logs. Imported project to studio 3.6.1.
Android studio was installed using snap repos on a debian system.
1) updated dependencies out of alphas to as new as possible while still compiling to run app on systems between KitKat and 10. 
Also updated Kotlin version to 1.3.70 for gradle since bundled version for studio is updated to 1.3.70.
Updated classpath for google services to 4.3.3
updated API and target build to 29 latest
updated gradle plugin, and updated gradle to 6.2.2

2) In build.gradel(:app), I added the following code after all updates due to JVM target 1.6 versus 1.8 at the bottom of the android {}.
android {

...

compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8.toString()
    }
}

3) App will build and load post tutorial, or if you are just comparing your work to master in order figure out what's wrong with it.
